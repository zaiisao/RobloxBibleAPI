# Usage
## Policy
This library was written for the purpose of advancing the gospel on Roblox through the creation of new disciples (Matthew 28:19), and thus we graciously ask that through the usage of this library that you can present the Bible in a respectful manner, including but not limited to the usage of scripture in its correct context and to take note of the copyright rules and policy of any Bible translation(s) used. More information can be found in the links above.

We also ask that your usage of this library is not used as a tool to argue against the following:
- Biblical inerrancy
- the existence of God, the creator of all things, who exists in three coexistent, coeternal, and coequal persons, as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
- the nature of Jesus Christ as fully God and fully man, his death on the cross and subsequent resurrection, ascension to heaven, and future second coming
- salvation by grace through faith alone in Jesus Christ

It is also worth knowing that each API has different terms of use policies and so we ask you that you verify the respective terms of use policy for the API that you use.
